1. Business Understanding
Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a company's customers into groups that reflect similarity among customers in each group. The goal of this project is to divide customers into groups based on common characteristics in order to maximize the value of each customer to the business.

2. Analytical Approach
Clustering of Customers based on similar characteristics is an Unsupervised Learning as for each observation we do not have any target variable. For this project I will use two Machine Learning models

I will use KMeans Clustering Algorithm which aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean
I will also use Hierarchical clustering which is an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters. The endpoint is a set of clusters, where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster, and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other.
3,4. Data Requirements and Data Collection
We would require a dataset which gives us information regarding customers from a market. For this project, the dataset has been provided to us on Kaggle. This data set is created only for the learning purpose of the customer segmentation concepts , also known as market basket analysis
